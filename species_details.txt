=== MACAW ===
Titles: FACTS, HOW YOU CAN HELP

--- FACTS ---
- The Amazonian rain forest is a bird lover's paradise, home to over a thousand different species, including the blue-and-yellow macaw. Macaws are highly intelligent, mate for life and can live up to 60 years. The vibrant color and pattern of their feathers make them a popular species in the illegal pet trade, which has devastated populations of wild exotic birds. WWF supports efforts to phase out importing wild birds to the United States and encourages captive breeding as an alternative to illegal capture.

=== JAGUAR ===
Titles: FACTS, WHY THEY MATTER, THREATS, WHAT WWF IS DOING, HOW YOU CAN HELP

--- FACTS ---
- Jaguars are mighty cats, most easily recognized by the bold rosettes generously spotted across their tawny-colored coats. They have thick, stocky legs and short, round ears. The jaguar has the strongest bite of all the felines. The name “jaguar” originates from the Tupi and Guarani languages of South America from the word yaguareté, or “true, fierce beast and he who kills in one leap.” The majestic jaguar is a symbol of power for many Latin-American cultures, it represents the power of nature and is seen as the protector of the rainforest.
- Jaguars are the third-largest cat in the world, with most weighing between 150 pounds and 250 pounds. However, their size varies by region, with jaguars in Central America being smaller than those found in the Amazon and the Pantanal. Jaguars are strictly carnivorous and are considered opportunistic hunters, meaning they will prey on almost any animal that crosses their path. Deer, peccaries, tapirs, iguanas, capybaras, armadillos, and monkeys are among the many kinds of animals that fall prey to jaguars. The powerful bite of jaguars makes them excellent hunters; their teeth possess the strength to pierce through crocodile hides and turtle shells. Once jaguars acquire meat for consumption, they use pointy bumps on their tongues, called papillae, to scrape the meat from its bones.
- These magnificent cats are distributed from Mexico to Argentina across 18 countries, and Brazil holds around half of the wild jaguars in the world. Their habitats include wet and dry forests, savannahs, and shrublands. Jaguars are strong swimmers and climbers and are dependent on healthy freshwater systems and access to large amounts of territory for survival.
- PLACES Amazon, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest

--- WHY THEY MATTER ---
Jaguars play an important role in maintaining the structure and function of the ecosystems they inhabit. As top predators, they help to keep a balance in the food chain where they live, playing an important role in controlling the populations of other species and promoting healthy ecosystems. Therefore, a jaguar-focused conservation strategy can serve as an effective umbrella for a suite of co-occurring species.

--- THREATS ---
- Due to diminishing territory and, thus, diminishing access to natural prey, jaguars have begun to look elsewhere for food. Livestock living on the lands that jaguars once inhabited often become meals for hungry jaguars, who are forced to feed on these domesticated animals in lieu of their natural prey. As a result, they become victims to farmers who might kill them in retaliation or in a preventative attempt to protect their income.
- Jaguars are apex predators mainly active during the night and require a large amount of territory to survive. Unfortunately, deforestation and agricultural activities have been encroaching on jaguar territory, slowly shrinking the range of jaguars and isolating populations from one another. It is estimated that jaguars have lost approximately 50% of their historic range, with a 20% decline in a period of just 14 years, and have gone extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay.
- Their habitats are becoming increasingly fragmented, meaning patches of habitat are decreasing in size and becoming increasingly isolated and less connected. The lands once ruled by jaguars are being destroyed by logging, large-scale agriculture, ranchland, and urban areas. Habitat fragmentation makes it incredibly difficult for these felines to hunt and mate, which poses a major threat to their population numbers and survival.
- The illegal trade in jaguar pelts and parts has played a large role in their population decline over time. In the 1960s, around 15,000 jaguar pelts were sold annually in the Brazilian Amazon to supply international markets in North America and Europe. The hunting of jaguars for pelts was not officially outlawed until the 1970s when national and international protections were put in place prohibiting the hunting and sale of jaguars and their parts.
- Since then, international demand for jaguar parts, particularly jaguar pelts, has reduced considerably. However, illegal domestic markets for jaguar body parts remain, posing a considerable threat to the species. This market is largely driven by opportunistic encounters between people and jaguars, human-jaguar conflict, and cultural practices surrounding jaguar use. In recent years, seizures of jaguar teeth at airports and post offices across Latin America and abroad have suggested a re-emergence of international trade in jaguar parts, raising the alarm around the devastating impacts of trade on jaguar populations. In addition, advances in technology and connectivity have led to an increased ease of buyers and sellers connecting globally online, further facilitating the illegal trade in jaguar products.
- A new series of decisions aimed at eliminating jaguar poaching and trafficking, including online trade, were approved at CITES COP19 in 2022. CITES—a treaty signed by 184 nations to support sustainable trade in wildlife and plants while protecting endangered species. The decisions call for enhanced stakeholder engagement and collaboration, the establishment of conservation corridors, strengthened cooperation mechanisms, increased investments into the conservation of the jaguar, including its habitat, and raising awareness about the importance of this apex predator, its ecological role, and the threats it faces.

--- WWF WORK ---
- WWF works to protect jaguars from extinction in cooperation with local communities, range state governments, and various partners. In 2020, WWF launched its Regional Jaguar Strategy with an ambitious goal to increase or stabilize jaguar populations, prey base, habitat, and connectivity by 2030. The strategy defines 15 WWF Jaguar Priority Landscapes, where it aims to secure jaguar strongholds, build connectivity, stop jaguar killings, catalyze cooperation, and create enabling conditions such as sustainable financing and political will.

- In order to achieve this goal, WWF works:

at the local landscape level by conducting jaguar monitoring, promoting best practices in productive landscapes, managing human-jaguar conflict, reducing jaguar killings, and contributing to improved management in protected areas;
at the national level by engaging the public and mainstreaming jaguar conservation across different sectors;
and at the international level by promoting long-term and large-scale finance for jaguar conservation and international cooperation.
WWF strives to ensure local communities are engaged in and benefit from conservation. WWF prioritizes raising awareness about the importance of recovering jaguars and their habitat for the benefit of nature and people.

- WWF also works with e-commerce, social media, and technology companies through the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online to address the trade of jaguars and their parts and other wildlife crimes on web-based platforms. Launched in 2018, the Coalition includes 47 member companies operating across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

=== POISON DART FROG ===
Titles: FACTS, HOW YOU CAN HELP

--- FACTS ---
- Many other frog species camouflage themselves in the wild, but the poison dart frog uses its brightly colored skin to warn predators that it is unfit to eat. The frog's skin secretes a dangerous poison that can paralyze and even kill predators. There are more than 100 species of poison dart frogs, including those that live in the Amazon.
- Climate change and habitat loss threaten their survival. WWF is working to ensure that their Amazon forest habitat remains intact.

=== BLACK SPIDER MONKEY ===
Titles: FACTS, WHY THEY MATTER, THREATS, WHAT WWF IS DOING, HOW YOU CAN HELP

--- FACTS ---
- The black spider monkey—also known as the Guiana or red-faced spider monkey—is found in eastern South America in areas north of the Amazon River. They are one of seven species of spider monkeys found in Latin America and one of the largest primate species in South America.
- PLACES Amazon

--- WHY THEY MATTER ---
The black spider monkey is an essential part of the tropical rainforest ecosystem. They play a key role in seed dispersal, allowing their forest environment to continue to grow and thrive.

--- THREATS ---
- The destruction of tropical rainforests and threats from hunting pose the greatest challenge to the black spider monkey’s survival. Because they prefer mature tropical forests and seldom venture into disturbed habitats, these monkeys are especially vulnerable to the effects of forest fragmentation.

--- WWF WORK ---
- To combat the destruction of the black spider monkey’s habitat, WWF works to protect the forests they need to survive. We support the creation and management of protected areas and promote responsible forest management, including Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, outside of protected areas.

=== AMAZON RIVER DOLPHIN ===
Titles: FACTS, WHY THEY MATTER, THREATS, WHAT WWF IS DOING, HOW YOU CAN HELP

--- FACTS ---
- The Amazon river dolphin, also known as the pink river dolphin or boto, lives only in freshwater. It is found throughout much of the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Venezuela. It is a relatively abundant freshwater cetacean with an estimated population in the tens of thousands. However, it is classified as vulnerable in certain areas due to dams that fragment and threaten certain populations, and from other threats such as contamination of rivers and lakes.
- PLACES : Amazon
- Scientific Name : Inia geoffrensis
- Weight : Up to 352 pounds
- Length : Up to 9.2 feet
- Habitats : Rivers and Lakes

--- WHY THEY MATTER ---
River dolphins are rapidly disappearing and so are their natural river habitats. Understanding the threats that impact them and protecting them ensures the preservation of their unique habitat.

--- THREATS ---
- The Amazon river dolphin is seen as a competitor for diminished fish stocks and is often killed or injured when people try to chase them away. In the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon, river dolphins are often deliberately killed for use as bait in the “mota” catfish fishery, which gathers fish that demand high prices in the city.
- Mercury pollution from small-scale gold mining activities are one of the main threats to the Bolivian river dolphin, a subspecies of the Amazon river dolphin. The mercury reaches dolphins through the food chain. They mainly eat catfish, which are bottom feeders greatly affected by metals like mercury in the water.

--- WWF WORK ---
- WWF works to protect river dolphin habitat in the Amazon region and continues to support river dolphin surveys to help determine their status and vulnerability. WWF also supports research about the impact of dams on the size and dispersal of dolphin populations.

=== SLOTH ===
Titles: FACTS, WHY THEY MATTER, THREATS, WHAT WWF IS DOING, HOW YOU CAN HELP

--- FACTS ---
- Sloths—the sluggish tree-dwellers of Central and South America—spend their lives in the tropical rainforests. They move through the canopy at a rate of about 40 yards per day, munching on leaves, twigs, and buds. Sloths have an exceptionally low metabolic rate and spend eight to 10 hours per day sleeping. And, surprisingly enough, the long-armed animals are excellent swimmers. They occasionally drop from their treetop perches into water for a paddle.
- There are two different types of sloths, two-toed and three-toed, and six species:
- Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus)
- Maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus)
- Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus)
- Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus)
- Linnaeus’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)
- Hoffman’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni)
- Of those, the pygmy sloth is critically endangered, and the maned sloth is vulnerable.
- PLACES Amazon

--- WHY THEY MATTER ---
Sloths are an integral part of tropical rain forest ecosystems. Among the most common mid-sized mammals in Central and South American rain forests is the brown-throated sloth.

--- THREATS ---
- The health of sloth populations is wholly dependent on the health of tropical rain forests. But tropical rain forests are at risk of deforestation. Without an abundance of trees, sloths will lose their shelter and food source. When sloths come to the forest floor—which they do once a week to relieve themselves—they are more exposed to predators and can do little to fend them off.

--- WWF WORK ---
- WWF works with communities, governments and companies to encourage sustainable forestry. WWF created the Global Forest & Trade Network to create a market for environmentally responsible forest products. The network works at national and regional levels to expand the area of forests under responsible management. And since 2003, WWF has been working with the Brazilian government on the Amazon Region Protected Areas initiative (ARPA) to protect rain forest. ARPA has become the largest conservation project in the world.
